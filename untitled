#### There are `r I(formatC(length(unique(rawdata$Route)), format='d', big.mark=','))` different routes in the data set. Do any of them stand out as having repeated late arrivals?
{r, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rawdata %>%
  select(Route, bell_late) %>%
  filter(!is.na(bell_late)) %>%
  group_by(Route) %>%
  summarise(median.bell.late = median(bell_late)) %>%
  arrange(desc(median.bell.late)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption='Routes with highest median of minutes arrived after the bell')
```

#### Route 42614004 has a median of 140 minutes bell late arrival. It's a **Wheelchair Bus** with destination **MASS HOSP SCH**, and it is scheduled to arrive just before noon, even though school starts at 08:45. It seems answering "which routes are often late" is going to be a bit complicated. Let's start by looking at the distribution of route counts.
{r, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- rawdata %>%
  group_by(Route) %>%
  tally()

ggplot(data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(n)) +
  xlab('Number of times a specific route occurs')
```

****
#### Looks like the average route operates per year.

#### Route 42614004 has a median of 140 minutes bell late arrival. It's a **Wheelchair Bus** with destination **MASS HOSP SCH**, and it is scheduled to arrive just before noon, even though school starts at 08:45. So this is clearly an edge case. Let's look at the median bell late by vehicle type.
{r, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rawdata %>%
  filter(!is.na(bell_late)) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(median.bell.late = median(bell_late)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption='Median bell late arrival by vehicle type')
```

****
#### What about the distribution of bell late arrival by vehicle type?
{r, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=8, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rawdata %>%
  filter(!is.na(bell_late)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(bell_late)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_grid(type ~ ., scales='free_y')
```

#### Let's look at the distribution of bus arrivals per school.
{r, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rawdata %>%
  group_by(school) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(n)) +
  xlab('Number of bus arrivals per school')
```

****
#### Let's look at the distribution of bus arrivals per school, by school type.
{r, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rawdata %>%
  filter(schtype != '') %>%
  group_by(school, schtype) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(n)) +
  xlab('Number of bus arrivals per school, by school type ') +
  facet_grid(schtype ~ .)
```

****
#### Let's look at the number of bus arrivals per school type.
{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', fig.width=10, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rawdata %>%
  filter(schtype != '') %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(schtype)) +
  coord_flip()
```
